# Feature-Engineering
This is a beginner friendly notebook for feature engineering

# Why Feature Engineering is Important

## Raw data is rarely ready to be used directly in a machine learning model. It often contains:
- Missing values
- Categorical variables
- Imbalanced data
- Irrelevant or redundant features
- Different scales of values
## Feature engineering helps to:
- Improve model accuracy
- Reduce overfitting
- Make patterns more clear
- Convert raw data into useful input for algorithms
- Improve overall model performance
In many real-world problems, feature engineering matters more than the choice of algorithm.
## What This Notebook Covers:
This notebook explains the core concepts in a simple and practical way:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Normalization & Standardization)
- Handling imbalanced data (Upsampling, Downsampling, SMOTE)
- Understanding why transformations are needed
- Practical implementation using Python

All concepts are explained step-by-step with code examples, making it suitable for beginners who are starting their journey in Data Analytics or Machine Learning.
